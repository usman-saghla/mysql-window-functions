# MySQL Window Functions Tutorial

This repository contains SQL scripts that demonstrate how to use **window functions** in MySQL 8+.  
Window functions let you perform advanced analyticsâ€”like ranking, running totals, moving averages, and comparisonsâ€”while still keeping row-level detail.

The examples are based on the classic **employees sample database**.
